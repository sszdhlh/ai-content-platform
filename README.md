## Architecture

Below is a simplified view of the system architecture (actual components may vary depending on your setup):

```
┌───────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐
│   Frontend     │ <--> │ Authentication │
│ (React/Vue/...)│      └────────────────┘
└───────────────┘
        |                 ┌─────────────────┐
        v                 │  AI/ML Models   │
┌──────────────────┐      └─────────────────┘
│   API Gateway     │
│(Node.js/NestJS/...)│      ┌───────────────────────┐
└──────────────────┘      │  Content Database      │
        |                 │ (MySQL/Postgres/Mongo) │
        v                 └───────────────────────┘
┌──────────────────┐
│   Integration     │
│   Services        │
│ (Plugins, etc.)   │
└──────────────────┘
```

1. **Frontend**: The UI where users interact with AI-driven features and content management tools.  
2. **API Gateway**: Facilitates communication between frontend clients, AI models, and databases.  
3. **AI/ML Models**: Includes GPT-based APIs or custom NLP engines.  
4. **Content Database**: Stores user data, drafts, documents, and metadata.  
5. **Integration Services**: Plugins and connectors for publishing, analytics, or external service interaction.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React / Next.js / Vue / Other SPA frameworks  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express/NestJS) / Python / Other server environments  
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB (depending on data requirements)  
- **AI Models**: GPT-based API (OpenAI) / Self-hosted ML solutions (Hugging Face, custom Transformers, etc.)  
- **Containerization** *(Optional)*: Docker & Docker Compose for deployment  
- **CI/CD** *(Optional)*: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other pipelines for automated builds and testing  

> *Adapt the above to reflect your actual implementation.*

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sszdhlh/ai-content-platform.git
   cd ai-content-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Or using yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. **Build the Project** *(If required by your framework)*  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

---

## Quick Start

1. **Development Mode**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server (commonly accessible at `http://localhost:3000` if using Next.js, or a port specified in your config).

2. **Production Mode**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   After building the project, this command will launch the application in a production environment.

3. **Docker Deployment** *(If Dockerfile is provided)*

   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-content-platform .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 ai-content-platform
   ```

---

## Configuration & Environment Variables

Most secure and environment-specific configurations (API keys, database connections, etc.) should be stored in a `.env` file or environment variable manager:

```bash
# Example .env file
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=YOUR_DB_USER
DB_PASS=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
...
```

- Make sure to **exclude** `.env` from version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.
- Access environment variables via `process.env.<VARIABLE_NAME>` in Node.js or your chosen approach.

---

## Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboards for content performance and user engagement.  
2. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Streamlined process for third-party integrations (SEO, grammar, style checks, etc.).  
3. **Offline Support**: Local caching and editing in limited connectivity scenarios.  
4. **Enterprise Plugins**: SSO, advanced role management, and audit trails for regulated industries.  
5. **Multilingual Support**: UI translations and improved cross-lingual NLP capabilities.
